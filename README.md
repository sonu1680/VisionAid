Problem Statement
Title: VisionAid: A Computer Vision Solution for the Visually Impaired

Visually impaired individuals face numerous challenges in navigating their environment, recognizing people, and reading text. VisionAid aims to provide an all-in-one solution to enhance their independence and quality of life.

Solution Overview
The VisionAid prototype will function as follows:

Object Detection and Classification: Identify and classify objects in real-time.
Face Recognition: Recognize and remember peopleâ€™s faces with names.
Path Guidance: Determine if a path is clear or obstructed.
Text Reading: Read text aloud to the user.
Ask Question: Provide real-time answers to user queries.
Hardware Components
Camera
LiDAR or Ultrasonic Sensors
Microphone and Speakers
Processing Unit
Software Components
OpenCV
YOLOv10
PyAudio
Python
JavaScript
TensorFlow
Use Cases
1. Navigating a Crowded Environment
User: Sarah, a visually impaired individual

Scenario: Sarah needs to navigate through a crowded shopping mall to reach a specific store.

Steps:

Initialization: Sarah puts on her VisionAid-equipped smart glasses.
Object Detection: The device starts detecting and classifying objects in real-time, identifying people, obstacles, and store signs.
Path Guidance: The path guidance system uses depth cameras to analyze the path ahead, providing audio feedback like "Clear path ahead" or "Obstacle detected, move slightly to the left."
Face Recognition: Sarah meets a friend in the mall, and the face recognition system identifies the friend, providing an audio prompt "John is approaching."
Text Reading: Sarah uses the text reading feature to capture and read aloud promotional signs at the store.
Outcome: Sarah successfully navigates the mall, meets her friend, and reads important information, enhancing her independence and confidence.

2. Ensuring Safe Pathways
User: David, a visually impaired individual

Scenario: David needs to walk to a nearby park and ensure the path is clear and safe.

Steps:

Initialization: David activates the path guidance feature on his VisionAid device.
Path Analysis: The device uses depth cameras to scan the path ahead.
Obstacle Detection: It detects any obstacles such as uneven surfaces, steps, or objects in the way.
Audio Guidance: The device provides real-time audio feedback such as "Clear path ahead" or "Caution, step up in 5 feet."
Navigation: David follows the audio instructions to navigate safely to the park.
Outcome: David navigates safely to the park, avoiding obstacles and ensuring a clear pathway.
